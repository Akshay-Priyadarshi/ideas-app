## SOCIAL NETWORK FOR STARTUP IDEAS

### ABSTRACT

##### As we know that India is experiencing a very massive growth in the startup segment. This is because of some very efficient steps taken by the government of India under make in India and many such other program.Our application as you can understand from the title is all about the evaluation process of the idea which is the first step for any startup.Entrepreneurs think that sharing their ideas would make it vulnerable and others would copy it. But actually, sharing your ideas is great as it allows you to validate it. No one wants to build something which does not have a demand in the market. Like suppose you build a product and no one uses itso all that effort and hard work you have put into it doesn't hold any value. Thus, we are trying to help entrepreneurs to get their idea validated by a network of people before building it.
